        <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium'">Greetings fellow surfers of the Web! My name is Ezekiel Lemma and welcome to my first ever website I've ever made! The purpose of this site is for you guys to get to learn a little more about me. Have fun exploring my site!</p>
        <p style="font-family: cursive;">I was born in the city of Portland, Oregon on November 16, 2001. I spent four years of my life in Oregon before I moved up to Puget Sound. I am of Ethiopian descent, as my parents were immigrants from Ethiopia. Some of my favorite hobbies include reading, excercising, and playing video games. I enjoy watching sports, as I am a huge Seahawks fan. But most of all, I'm a mostly chill person who always enjoys relaxing.</p>
